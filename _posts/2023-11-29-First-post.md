# First Blog

Hello everyone,

I have always been fond of writing about my experiences or lessons learned from my life and career in a diary so that I won't repeat the same mistakes again and learn from past experiences. 
Today is a special day for me yes its my birthday(29/11), and I want to make certain changes in my life which includes to help others. So from now onwards, I will be sharing my thoughts, opinions, lessons, and experiences through my blog.

Since I'm new to this blogging thing, I'm not sure how things will go in the future. However, I will definitely keep writing. One thing I can guarantee is that you will learn something from these blogs that will help you somewhere in your life, even if it's just 1% and that is my whole "motive".
